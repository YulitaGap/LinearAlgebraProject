# Application of linear algebra for image compression

The field we want to cover with our research project is focused on the problem of the images compression.
Our goal is to make the research on the elegant application of mathematical tools and concepts (in particular from linear algebra and numerical analysis) to the problem of image compression, and illustrate how certain theoretical mathematical results can be effectively used in applications that include transformations in the image representation.
